# TO DO LIST


* response to key press
* response to scroll (not many people with left right scroll, but they do on mobile)
* figure out how's it with screen reader
* experience page make the details collapse until clicked on, add a downward triangle next to the title
* animate the arrows to make it more fancy and show what the page is on hover

## will start working on sth else before doing these

* make 4 more pages for the edges
* animate page transitions
* the horizontal center alignment need to take the footer as a consideration too
